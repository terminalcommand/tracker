# Tracker
A small utility to track time. Exports to excel compatible csv.

# How to use
Run the script in python3 (e.g. python3 tracker.py)
Follow the instructions on the screen :)

Example:
  Name of the item: **Coding tracker.py**
  Enter start time: (blank for current)  **Either enter time e.g 20:02 or just hit enter**
  Enter end time: (blank for timer) **Either enter time or hit enter**
  (Type in 'end' to stop timer...)  **Type end to stop timer**

The script will automatically log all your entries in a csv file.
You do not need to worry about dates, as your logs will be saved in a seperate file for each day.

e.g. 20171115.csv
